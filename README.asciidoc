Maven Base Docker Image
-----------------------

Building
~~~~~~~~

`docker build -t base-maven .`

Example Usage
~~~~~

* `cd [workDir]`

* `docker run -v {backtick}pwd{backtick}:/opt/jboss/myproject:z base-maven mvn clean install -f /opt/jboss/myproject`

This will execute "mvn clean install" using the container to build the sources in `workDir`.  Note that each run is idempotent and will trigger a build with a fresh, non-cached m2 repository.
